# NO NAME COZY GAME

Developed for the March [Game Creator's Club] at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is "Cozy". 

## Game

Cozy Light is a turn-based cozy game where you control an Unlighted One in his adventure to light the Dark.
Player can move around using cursors or WASD, and can interact by selecting the right action from the lower-right corner.
The game is incomplete and is mostly a proof of concept, although it features a tutorial and a simple initial quest.

## To do

- Stuff for future
  - Load/Save system
  - Generic planting system
    - Seed -> (+dirt/plant) -> Sappling -> (+water/time) -> Tree -> (+axe with multiple hits) -> Stump and Seed and Lumber -> (+destumper) -> Dirt
    - Seed -> (+dirt/plant) -> Flower -> (cut with knife) -> Dirt + Seed
    - Till terrain (none => dirt)
  - Readd stump
  - Chain with small "something" that's being attacked by shadowfiends, we need to protect it with light
    - Chain with attracting fireflies (?)
  - In world containers (pickups can be done with that, grid actions probably need parameters)
  - Need to make cheese (cow, get milk, etc)
  - Blacksmith
    - Needs "Silvermoon Sand", that can only be gathered from a beach in the moonlight, when lit by the Moonfish
    - Need to lure the Moonfish
      - Grab worm (?)  
    - Can smelt stuff, convert 10xSand into 1xFire Flower Seed  
  - Equipment system
    - Equipment slots
    - Player needs to equip stuff before using (instead of auto use) => Test A
    - Player needs to equip anything before use => Test B
